            <h1> A Critical Reflection On Making My First Website </h1>
            <h2 class="subheading"> I did it! </h2>
            
            <p> So what’s even going on here you might ask! What is the purpose of you ending up on another blog that you probably won’t follow until someone on the Internet takes to twitter to rave about it? Well less just get this out of the way. </p>
            
            <p> My Website is called Looking At the Past Though Contemporary Eyes the purpose of it is for me. Yes this is about me of course. The title comes from a very mundane place. My eyes are contemporary and I will be looking into the past for inspiration and material. The title isn’t that original but that isn’t why the blog is here. As much as I may strive for originality to stand out here in a competitive academic world. This isn’t what my blog will be based on. Content will be what is focuses on. My hope if for this blog to be a host to the archaeological work I will be doing during my undergraduate degree. I want to bring you the reader into my world, to learn while I do. I want to share my not so vast wisdom with anyone who might have questions or stumble upon this corner of the Internet. Honestly because it helps me get smarter. I often find myself rattling around in my own brain when it comes to archaeology and connecting with other people about this topic would be great. </p>
            
            <p> Let’s get into the meat of this now. You might be thinking that ramble above isn’t the meat of it? Well reader no it isn’t the meat of it is the design and code the hard part. I designed the blog to be clean and easy with a user-friendly experience. First because you the visitor the people who will be interacting with this platform need to be able to navigate it, secondly because I need to be able to navigate it. Again remember this blog is an extension of my ego. This is my first coding project and I would like it to not be something that I hate. I wanted the user to be able to understand the blog with easy. By having easy to locate tabs at the top of the page. The headers being photo’s I’ve taken myself, with text plain clear overlaid text. Clean again is the theme. </p>
            
            <p> Some issues I faced will create my blog were all around coding and importing images. I had issues with importing my images into github then attaching them to my HTML files. This however was fixed with someone pointing out to me that I had deleted part of my code and just needed to fix that. After I fixed the section of code. It worked. The way the headers look now is one of my favourite things about the blog layout. Photography is a passion of mine and I love it when I get to share my work. By using my own images as headers. Each image is from a different place on Vancouver island, ranging from Coast Salish territories up to Nuuchaanulth and Kwakwaka'wakw areas. </p>
            
            <p> Designing this blog was a challenge as previously mentioned. As you might be able to see from poking around the blog, it isn’t very complicated. My best friend became Google and CodeCademy. Whenever I had an issue, Google. Whenever I have a question, Google. Whenever CSS became baffling to me CodeCademy. I know feel confident in my skills and more secure on how to produce a basic website, how to navigate HTML and CSS. Though JavaScript eludes me. I have a feeling that will be my next challenge on CodeCademy. I would like to be able to integrate a map or timeline of some kind into a blog post. Adding in those JavaScript flares of interactivity that CSS and HTML can’t provide. </p>
            
            <p> So here we are now, the meat of this is explained. My blog is not the fanciest of things and honestly I hope I can jazz it up as I go. I feel happy with how it has turned out and am already thinking about the kinds of things I would like to post about and explore. </p>
