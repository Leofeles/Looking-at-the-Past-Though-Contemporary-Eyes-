            <h1> A Critical Reflection On Twine </h1>
    <p> For my third portfolio project I chose to create a simple game with Twine. I used it once before earlier in the semesters to experiment with game design and storytelling with digital media. I originally tried experimenting with Unity. I could not navigate the interface that well though, and was not able to create something I was happy with even after following YouTube tutorials. My game is a choose you’re own adventure game running though simple questions regarding anthropological facts. When did Homo sapiens appear? When was the start of civilization?  Are some examples of questions used in my game. I do believe that this could be a very use for tool when creating interactive media related to digital archeology. </p>
            <p> I struggled to design this project. Originally I had grand plans for what my game could be. There could be drawing or gods, and cities and people unfortunately I ran out of time. I had some drawings done but nothing came out quite right or I ran out of time. This final project was not difficult just another thing on the list of stuff needed to be completed. In the future I would a lot more time to design and storyboard my idea. The second thing I would do differently is make this into a group project, which allows for the specialization of task. Because I wanted to do some many things and ran out of time, I feel as if being able to  storyboard with a group, having one or two people work on twine and another person drawing and many one person researching the game could be much more in-depth and interactive. </p>

            <h1> Portfolio II Thoughts, Feelings and Reflections.  </h1>
            
            <p> This project was hard. Creating <a class="text-warning" href="https://leofeles.github.io/Mesopotamia-Heritage-Jam/#page-top">Discover Mesopotamia </a> was conceptually new and the skills I learned to do it were brand new to me. The original goal for this project was to submit it to the heritage jam and it would be beautiful! That did not happen for a few reasons. The main one I would say was I was not ready to have strangers critique something I was insecure about. This was the second website I have every build and I like it, I feel proud of it. With that though I know it has design flaws and the research I did could have been better. I had a vision and this project as it is now I feel it is 80% there, it is close to that vision but not they’re yet. I didn’t feel comfortable submitting something that so far from that vision. The second this about submitting to the heritage jam was that it would exist beyond the realm that is Anth 485, and the safely of Github. The Internet could get a hold of it. So as a digital citizen I decided against putting this out there in that way. </p>
            
            <p> The first thing I learned when building this website is how hard it is to personalize the template to meet my vision. A lot of my time was spent trying to figure out the tags that would help me do that. Google again became my right hand man all the way though. The second thing I learned was formatting fonts is also very difficult when you have no idea what tag to use. I eventually stumbled across the tags I needed however the process of learning what those tags were took a couple hours. Font tags and linking up buttons to find locate the right ID was a challenge for me.  </p>
            
            <p> I have come to appreciate the process of coding and visualization more it is difficult. Some programs are easier then others. Each one comes with its own set of rules and skills that lend well to it. For intense Carto is very easy when you have the longitude and latitude of a place, but if you don’t I found it very hard to find the right location of a city for my map. The result is a ruff place with the approximate locations of these past cities. I am a bit happy it turned out that way because I do have ethical concerns with releasing information of exact archaeological sites. However I wanted to originally use Leaflet to create a map and had a hard time learning how to use it when trying with my practice map and ending up not continuing with it because of how much time it was taking up. Resulting in me using Carto to create my blogs map. </p>
            
            <p> Over all this assignment was fun even if it was hard. I had a lot of fun creating an interactive platform about Mesopotamia a Civilization often thought about when archaeology is talked about in schools and outside of academia. The part that was the most fun and practical about the project for me was getting to create the coloring sheets. I loved doing interpretations of each of the gods and what I though they might look like and then am able to share those with other people. Outside of this project I got to show the website to my nephew who sat with me and loving clicking on links and playing with the word map. I cannot speak to how much information a 4 year old could absorb but it was nonetheless fun to have him play with a platform I had created. That is one of the things I like about this project and class is the ability to transfer this knowledge to my life and be able to share what I know about archaeology in a practical way with others who might not ever think about this discipline. I truly believe that archaeology will thrive if it embraces media and technology. Creating projects and ways of learning that are interactive and immersive. </p>

            <h1> A Critical Reflection On Making My First Website </h1>
            
            
            <p> So what’s even going on here you might ask! What is the purpose of you ending up on another blog that you probably won’t follow until someone on the Internet takes to twitter to rave about it? Well less just get this out of the way. </p>
            
            <p> My Website is called Looking At the Past Though Contemporary Eyes the purpose of it is for me. Yes this is about me of course. The title comes from a very mundane place. My eyes are contemporary and I will be looking into the past for inspiration and material. The title isn’t that original but that isn’t why the blog is here. As much as I may strive for originality to stand out here in a competitive academic world. This isn’t what my blog will be based on. Content will be what is focuses on. My hope if for this blog to be a host to the archaeological work I will be doing during my undergraduate degree. I want to bring you the reader into my world, to learn while I do. I want to share my not so vast wisdom with anyone who might have questions or stumble upon this corner of the Internet. Honestly because it helps me get smarter. I often find myself rattling around in my own brain when it comes to archaeology and connecting with other people about this topic would be great. </p>
            
            <p> Let’s get into the meat of this now. You might be thinking that ramble above isn’t the meat of it? Well reader no it isn’t the meat of it is the design and code the hard part. I designed the blog to be clean and easy with a user-friendly experience. First because you the visitor the people who will be interacting with this platform need to be able to navigate it, secondly because I need to be able to navigate it. Again remember this blog is an extension of my ego. This is my first coding project and I would like it to not be something that I hate. I wanted the user to be able to understand the blog with easy. By having easy to locate tabs at the top of the page. The headers being photo’s I’ve taken myself, with text plain clear overlaid text. Clean again is the theme. </p>
            
            <p> Some issues I faced will create my blog were all around coding and importing images. I had issues with importing my images into github then attaching them to my HTML files. This however was fixed with someone pointing out to me that I had deleted part of my code and just needed to fix that. After I fixed the section of code. It worked. The way the headers look now is one of my favourite things about the blog layout. Photography is a passion of mine and I love it when I get to share my work. By using my own images as headers. Each image is from a different place on Vancouver island, ranging from Coast Salish territories up to Nuuchaanulth and Kwakwaka'wakw areas. </p>
            
            <p> Designing this blog was a challenge as previously mentioned. As you might be able to see from poking around the blog, it isn’t very complicated. My best friend became Google and CodeCademy. Whenever I had an issue, Google. Whenever I have a question, Google. Whenever CSS became baffling to me CodeCademy. I know feel confident in my skills and more secure on how to produce a basic website, how to navigate HTML and CSS. Though JavaScript eludes me. I have a feeling that will be my next challenge on CodeCademy. I would like to be able to integrate a map or timeline of some kind into a blog post. Adding in those JavaScript flares of interactivity that CSS and HTML can’t provide. </p>
            
            <p> So here we are now, the meat of this is explained. My blog is not the fanciest of things and honestly I hope I can jazz it up as I go. I feel happy with how it has turned out and am already thinking about the kinds of things I would like to post about and explore. </p>
